* [2023-11-28]: üöÄüöÄ Codes released.

## üéØ Overview
![VCD](figs/figure1.png)
- We introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), **a simple and training-free** method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs.
- The new **contrastive probability distribution** for decoding is formulated as follows:
```math
p_{vcd}(y \mid v, v', x) = softmax[ (1+\alpha)\times logit_\theta (y \mid v, x) - \alpha \times logit_\theta(y \mid v', x)],
```
- The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on **statistical bias** and **unimodal priors**, two essential causes of object hallucinations.


## üïπÔ∏è Usage
### Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -yn vcd python=3.9
conda activate vcd
cd VCD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Use VCD in LVLMs

The two core function of VCD, adding noise to images and generating text based on VCD sampling, are found in the `vcd_utils` folder. Scripts for using VCD sampling in LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and QwenVL are located in `VCD/eval`. We have annotated some key changes with `## cd_comment` for easy location using ctrl+f.

To help you get started quickly, here's an example using LLaVA on how to replace the conventional sampling method with the VCD method during generation:
1. Add the following at the beginning of the start-up script:
```python
from vcd_utils.vcd_sample import evolve_vcd_sampling
evolve_vcd_sampling()
```
The `evolve_vcd_sampling` function replaces the sampling function in the transformers library. The modified sampling function includes an option for visual contrastive decoding, while keeping the rest unchanged.

2. Slightly modify `llava_llama.py`:

   a. Add contrastive decoding parameters in the `LlavaLlamaForCausalLM` class's `forward` function to avoid exceptions in `model.generate`.
   
   b. Add the `prepare_inputs_for_generation_cd` function.

3. Add noise to the image:
```python
from vcd_utils.vcd_add_noise import add_diffusion_noise
image_tensor_cd = add_diffusion_noise(image_tensor, args.noise_step)
```
set the hyperparameter in the `generate` function:
```python
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    images=image_tensor.unsqueeze(0).half().cuda(),
    images_cd=(image_tensor_cd.unsqueeze(0).half().cuda() if image_tensor_cd is not None else None),
    cd_alpha = args.cd_alpha,
    cd_beta = args.cd_beta,
    do_sample=True)
```

## üèÖ Experiments
- **VCD significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families.**
![exp1](figs/exp1.png)
*table 1(Part of). Results on POPE. Regular decoding denotes direct sampling, whereas VCD refers to sampling from our proposed contrastive distribution pvcd. The best performances within each setting are bolded.*

- **Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability.**
